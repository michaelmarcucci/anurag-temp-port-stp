### Bonus ‚≠ê

This portfolio template contain a Spotify Card component [here](./components/Misc/Spotify.card.tsx) which shows the current streaming song on spotify.

**Example:**

To configure this, you need to connect spotify to your discord account and add your User ID to the component.

In the [Spotify.card.tsx](./components/Misc/Spotify.card.tsx) component, change the following line:

```js
const DISCORD_ID = "<your_discord_id>";
```

And you're good to go!
